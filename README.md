# Implementation_of_chatbot_using_NLP

This project implements an intelligent chatbot using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, specifically utilizing the NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) library and Streamlit for the user interface. The chatbot is designed to engage in natural conversations by recognizing patterns in user input and generating appropriate responses. Built with pattern-matching algorithms and predefined response templates, the system can handle various conversation scenarios including greetings, personal queries, educational assistance, and small talk. The implementation features a user-friendly web interface created with Streamlit, making it accessible to users through a simple text-based interaction model. The chatbot demonstrates the practical application of basic NLP concepts in creating interactive conversational agents.
